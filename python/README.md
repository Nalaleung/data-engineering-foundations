## IDE

The first thing you would need to develop any code is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Depending on the language, most IDE are customized to have components such as compilers, intepeters, and/or package installers to help speed up development and test for bugs. 

For Python, I recommend using Visual Studios Code. VS Code is a fairly light weight IDE that can be used for a wide variety of languages as long as you download the extensions needed.

### Python Extension

As mentioned earlier, VS Code would need a Python extension to get you started in your python development.

## Jupyter Notebook

Generally a lot of developers (e.g. Data Scientist, Data Engineers, etc.) use Jupyter notebook to test segments of their python code before wrapping it together in one script. I would recommend giving this extension a try while you practices the lesson files.
