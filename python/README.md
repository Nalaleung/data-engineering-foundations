# Python Develpment

## IDE

The first thing you would need to develop any code is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Depending on the language, most IDE are customized to have components such as compilers, intepeters, and/or package installers to help speed up development and test for bugs. 

For Python, I recommend using Visual Studios Code. VS Code is a fairly light weight IDE that can be used for a wide variety of languages as long as you download the extensions needed.
