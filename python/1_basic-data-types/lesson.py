## 1. Basic Data Types
## 1.a) Number Types
x = 34 # Integer Type
y1 = 4 # Integer Type
y2 = 4.0 # Float Type

# What are the difference between both divisions statements? Why is that?
# Bonus: Run the below using Python2 and Python 3
print(x / y1)
print(x / y2)

# What are the difference between both multiplication statements? Why is that?
# Bonus: Run the below using Python2 and Python 3
print(x * y1)
print(x * y2)

## 1.b) String Type
# Create a string variable 'name' that will be used in the print statement below
print(f'Welcome to {name} python code')

# 2. Data type conversion



## 3. String Manipulation


## 4. Date Time and Time zone Offset
import datetime

## 4.a) Print the current time using the datetime library

## 4.b) Print the time in the above answer in the full date format (e.g. Sunday Febuary 12 2023)

## 4.c) Using the above time, create the following statement using the current time variable
## 'Right now its HH:MM (AM/PM) on [Weekday], [Month] [Day], [Year]'
## E.g. 'Right now its 8:23 PM on Sunday, February 12, 2023'

## 4.d) Using the logic above, create the same statement but convert to the approriate time zone in:
## - Vancouver
## - Paris
## - Tokyo
## E.g. 'Right now in Tokyo its 10:23 AM on Sunday, February 13, 2023'

## 4.e) Write a python statement that will print the current amount of days till Christmas
