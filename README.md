## Getting Started

The first thing to do would be to clone this repository and branch out from main. You would need to install the

### Git Installation

Below is the documentation for the git package

https://git-scm.com/

It is a good idea to be familiarized with several of the common git commnads such as:
- git clone 
- git add <files>
- git commit -m "<Message>"
- git push
- git pull
- git branch <branch-name>

Aside from the CLI, tools can be used to grant a GUI management for Git. I personally used GitHub Desktop since the tool is pretty robust. The download can be found below:
